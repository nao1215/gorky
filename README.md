# gorky - powerful & bitter utility library
gorky is a library of generic utility code for golang. When the autho r(it's me) was creating OSS projects, I copied the code into the project many times. I felt this process was a waste of time. For this reason, I have put together a generic code as the gorky library.

# Origin of name (gorky)
gorky was taken from Pokémon and a Russian writer (Maxim Gorky). gorky evolves by exchanging Pokémon with other people's Pokémon. Similarly, I hoped that the use of the gorky library in other codes would make them better.

In Russia, gorky is both the name of the writer and a word meaning "bitter".  I thought gorky meant very well, as there will be hard times on the road to a better library.
